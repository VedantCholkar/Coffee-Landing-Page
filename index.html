                <img class="coffee-type-image" src="assets/espresso.png" alt="espresso">
                <p class="coffee-type-des">The espresso, also known as a short black, is approximately 1 oz. of highly
                    concentrated coffee. Although simple in appearance, it can be difficult to master. </p>
            </li>

                <img class="coffee-type-image" src="assets/coffee-drinks_double-espresso.png" alt="double espresso">
                <p class="coffee-type-des">A double espresso may also be listed as doppio, which is the Italian word for
                    double. This drink is highly concentrated and strong. </p>
            </li>
            <li class="coffee-type">
                <img class="coffee-type-image" src="assets/coffee-drinks_red-eye.png" alt="red eye">
                <p class="coffee-type-des">The red eye's purpose is to add a boost of caffeine to your standard cup of
                    coffee.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="coffee-type">
                <img class="coffee-type-image" src="assets/coffee-drinks_black-eye.png" alt="black eye">
                <p class="coffee-type-des">The black eye is just the doubled version of the red eye and is very high in
                    caffeine.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="coffee-type">
                <img class="coffee-type-image" src="assets/coffee-drinks_americano.png" alt="americano">
                <p class="coffee-type-des">Americanos are popular breakfast drinks and thought to have originated during
                    World War II. Soldiers would add water to their coffee to extend their rations farther. The water
                    dilutes the espresso while still maintaining a high level of caffeine. </p>
            </li>
            <li class="coffee-type">
                <img class="coffee-type-image" src="assets/coffee-drinks_long-black.png" alt="long black">
                <p class="coffee-type-des">The long black is a similar coffee drink to the americano, but it originated
                    in New Zealand and Australia. It generally has more crema than an americano. </p>
            </li>
            <li class="coffee-type">
                <img class="coffee-type-image" src="assets/coffee-drinks_macchiato.png" alt="macchiato">
                <p class="coffee-type-des">The word macchiato means mark or stain. This is in reference to the mark that
                    steamed milk leaves on the surface of the espresso as it is dashed into the drink. Flavoring syrups
                    are often added to the drink according to customer preference.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="coffee-type">
                <img class="coffee-type-image" src="assets/coffee-drinks_long-macchiato.png" alt="long macchiato">
                <p class="coffee-type-des">Often confused with a standard macchiato, the long macchiato is a taller
                    version and will usually be identifiable by its distinct layers of coffee and steamed milk. </p>
            </li>
            <li class="coffee-type">
                <img class="coffee-type-image" src="assets/coffee-drinks_cortado.png" alt="cortado">
                <p class="coffee-type-des">The cortado takes the macchiato one step further by evenly balancing the
                    espresso with warm milk in order to reduce the acidity. </p>
            </li>
            <li class="coffee-type">
                <img class="coffee-type-image" src="assets/coffee-drinks_breve.png" alt="breve">
                <p class="coffee-type-des">The breve provides a decadent twist on the average espresso, adding steamed
                    half-and-half to create a rich and creamy texture. </p>
            </li>
            <li class="coffee-type">
                <img class="coffee-type-image" src="assets/coffee-drinks_cappuccino.png" alt="cappuccino">
                <p class="coffee-type-des">This creamy coffee drink is usually consumed at breakfast time in Italy and
                    is loved in the United States as well. It is usually associated with indulgence and comfort because
                    of its thick foam layer and additional flavorings that can be added to it. </p>
            </li>
            <li class="coffee-type">
                <img class="coffee-type-image" src="assets/coffee-drinks_flat-white.png" alt="flat white">
                <p class="coffee-type-des">A flat white also originates from New Zealand and Australia and is very
                    similar to a cappuccino but lacks the foam layer and chocolate powder. To keep the drink creamy
                    rather than frothy, steamed milk from the bottom of the jug is used instead of from the top. </p>
            </li>
            <li class="coffee-type">
                <img class="coffee-type-image" src="assets/coffee-drinks_caffe-latte.png" alt="cafe latte">
                <p class="coffee-type-des">Cafe lattes are considered an introductory coffee drink since the acidity and
                    bitterness of coffee are cut by the amount of milk in the beverage. Flavoring syrups are often added
                    to the latte for those who enjoy sweeter drinks.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="coffee-type">
                <img class="coffee-type-image" src="assets/coffee-drinks_mocha.png" alt="mocha">
                <p class="coffee-type-des">The mocha is considered a coffee and hot chocolate hybrid. The chocolate
                    powder or syrup gives it a rich and creamy flavor and cuts the acidity of the espresso. </p>
            </li>
            <li class="coffee-type">
                <img class="coffee-type-image" src="assets/coffee-drinks_vienna.png" alt="vienna">
                <p class="coffee-type-des">There are a few variations on the Vienna, but one of the most common is made
                    with two ingredients: espresso and whipped cream. The whipped cream takes the place of milk and
                    sugar to provide a creamy texture.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="coffee-type">
                <img class="coffee-type-image" src="assets/coffee-drinks_affogato.png" alt="affogato">
                <p class="coffee-type-des">Affogatos are more for a dessert coffee than a drink you would find at a
                    cafe, but they can add a fun twist to your coffee menu. They are made by pouring a shot of espresso
                    over a scoop of vanilla ice cream to create a sweet after-meal treat. </p>
            </li>
            <li class="coffee-type">
                <img class="coffee-type-image" src="assets/coffee-drinks_cafe-au-lait.png" alt="cafe au lait">
                <p class="coffee-type-des">The cafe au lait is typically made with French press coffee instead of an
                    espresso shot to bring out the different flavors in the coffee. It is then paired with scalded milk
                    instead of steamed milk and poured at a 50/50 ratio. </p>
            </li>
            <li class="coffee-type">
                <img class="coffee-type-image" src="assets/coffee-drinks_iced-coffee.png" alt="iced coffee">
                <p class="coffee-type-des">Iced coffees become very popular in the summertime in the United States. The
                    recipes do have some variance, with some locations choosing to interchange milk with water in the
                    recipe. Often, different flavoring syrups will be added per the preference of the customer.</p>
